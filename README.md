## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories
  - First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time User, I want to fully understanding what this game is and the purpose of it the moment I enter the website. I can clearly see the purpose of the game in the title of the website that it is a geography quiz to test my knowledge in geography.

    2. As a First Time User, I want to be able to understand how to play this game and what to expect. I can clearly see the 'How To Play' button which shows me thorough instructions.

    3. As a First Time User, I want this website to be easy on the eyes and easy to navigate. I can clearly see that the website is nicely designed and everything is clearly placed. The title of the website is large at the header, the 'Play' and 'How To Play' buttons are large and very visible so I know exactly how to navigate myself around the website. 

    4. As a First Time User, I want to be able to know exactly what my score is and how I know when I have beaten the level and game. The score is visibly shown at the bottom of the page and the website clearly communicates when I have beaten or lost a level. 
 
  - Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning and Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to play this game without being able to cheat to really test my knowledge and skills. I also want to be able to save the quiz question I was at when I accidentally refresh the page or close my device for the day. The local storage in the website saves the exact question I was on before I left the page and it does not restart the quiz to the start. 

    2. As a Returning and Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to beat my old score or beat a level that I have failed to complete. The 'play again' button allows me to replay the game when I have lost or beaten the full game. I can keep track of my new, refreshed score at the bottom of the page when I restart the game. 

    3. As a Returning and Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to keep in touch with the creator of the website or perhaps keep in touch with updates to the game. When I scroll down, I see there are social media links at the bottom that I can click on and takes me to a different tab so I do not navigate out of the game website.
